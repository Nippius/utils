# About

Truncate is a C# implementation of the unix truncate utility. This can come really handy
when truncating ISO images in order to fit on a SD Card for example.

## Todo

1. Add support for multiplicative suffixes if SIZE is specified.
2. Add support for truncating files in parallel.
3. Add support for asynchronously truncate files.
